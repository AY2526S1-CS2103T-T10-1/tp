# BizBook

- This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

## Overview

BizBook is a desktop application designed for university students actively managing multiple internship applications. The application helps students track and organize their internship hunting process effectively.

- The project is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
- It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

## Target Audience

University students who are actively applying for multiple internships and need a reliable system to:

- Track multiple applications simultaneously
- Monitor application statuses effectively
- Maintain detailed records of each application
- Organize applications by industry and company

## Value Proposition

For students buried in internship applications, our internship tracker helps to cut through the clutter of spreadsheets and web apps. It helps you manage your entire application pipeline so you can stay organized, focused and in control of your internship hunt.
